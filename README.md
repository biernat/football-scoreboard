# Live Football World Cup Score Board

A simple Java library to manage live football game scores. It allows you to:

- Start new games

## ðŸ“† Assumptions

- Supported teams are predefined using a static list in an enum (`Team`).
- Only one active game is allowed between any two teams at a time.

## ðŸ“† CI Workflow

The project includes a GitHub Actions CI workflow that builds and tests the project on every push or pull request to the
`main` branch.

## ðŸ“¦ Build & Test

This project uses Maven and Java 17.
